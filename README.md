# ZHFLIM Player

A high‑end video showcase built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**, inspired by Apple’s elegant design language.

## ✨ Features

- **Card‑style video deck** with buttery‑smooth transitions  
- **Three external videos** served from object storage & cached in a Service Worker  
- **Animated rain‑streak background** overlays the entire viewport  
- **ZHFLIM logo** anchored in the top‑left corner  
- Fully responsive & production‑ready (PWA enabled)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install deps
npm install          # or pnpm install / yarn install

# Dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev
```

## 🏗️ Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The Service Worker is registered automatically in production to cache your videos.
